 **Manim Video Evaluation Rubric (v2 - Aesthetics Enhanced)**

**Instructions:** Evaluate the provided video segment based *strictly* on the corresponding input script text, associated metadata (like timestamps, if provided), and the criteria below. Prioritize accuracy and clarity, but also consider visual appeal using standard Manim capabilities.

**1. Script Fidelity & Content Accuracy:**
    *   **Core Concepts:** Accurately represents main subjects/ideas from the script?
    *   **Key Actions:** Essential actions/transformations visualized?
    *   **Presence:** Crucial elements present? Distracting unscripted elements absent?

**2. Timing & Synchronization (Evaluate ONLY if timestamps provided):**
    *   **Event Alignment:** Visual events reasonably close (+/- 1s) to specified timestamps?
    *   **Pacing:** Animation timing feels appropriate for the segment's duration/actions?

**3. Visual Clarity & Composition:**
    *   **Readability:** Text legible (size, contrast, duration)? Objects distinguishable?
    *   **Layout & Spacing:** Elements arranged clearly? Good use of space? Scene uncluttered? Consistent alignment?
    *   **Overlap:** Elements avoid obstructing critical information?
    *   **Framing:** Important elements fully within frame?
    *   **Color & Contrast:** Effective use of color for clarity and visual distinction? Good contrast between elements and background?

**4. Animation Quality & Engagement:**
    *   **Smoothness:** Animations relatively smooth? (Ignore minor rendering glitches).
    *   **Relevance & Engagement:** Are standard Manim animations (e.g., FadeIn, Write, Transform, Grow) used *effectively* and *relevantly* to enhance understanding or visual interest? Avoids overly distracting/jarring effects.

**Overall Assessment:**

*   **Summary:** Briefly state if the video successfully visualizes the script segment according to the criteria. Mention key strengths/weaknesses, including comments on **visual appeal (layout, color, animation choices)**.
*   **(Constraint Guidance):** Basic accuracy (Crit. 1) and clarity (Crit. 3) are essential for PASS. Shortcomings *only* in aesthetic aspects (parts of Crit. 3 like color/spacing, or Crit. 4 engagement) should be noted but typically **should not cause a FAIL** unless they severely harm readability or accuracy. Do not expect complex custom artistry.
*   **Conclusion:** Conclude with the exact phrase required:
    *   **"Overall Assessment: PASS"** if criteria 1 & 3 are met adequately (prioritizing accuracy/readability/framing), and criterion 2 if applicable.
    *   **"Overall Assessment: FAIL"** if major inaccuracies (Crit. 1), critical clarity/composition problems (Crit. 3 - readability, framing, severe clutter/overlap), or critical timing failures (Crit. 2, if applicable).

**(Self-Correction Reminder for LLM):** Focus on the segment/script. Prioritize accuracy and clarity. Encourage good standard aesthetics but do not demand perfection or non-standard effects. Note aesthetic issues but only fail if core requirements are unmet.**
