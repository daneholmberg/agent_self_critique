**Manim Eval Rubric**

**Instructions:** Evaluate video vs. script/metadata with a critical eye.
Think of the point of view of a viewer. Do they understand what's happening? Do things move with good pace? Is it too much to take in at once?
Prioritize accuracy/clarity, then aesthetics (standard Manim).

**Part A: Core Requirements (PASS/FAIL - ALL MUST PASS)**

1.  **Accuracy (P/F):** Represents core concepts/info? Essential actions/elements present? No misleading extras?
2.  **Clarity/Framing (P/F):** Primary text legible? Critical elements distinguishable? No essential info fully obscured by overlap? Critical elements mostly on-screen?
3.  **Timing (P/F, if timestamps provided):** Key events roughly sync (+/- 1.5s)? Pacing not critically broken?

**Part B: Qualitative Assessment (1-5 Scale)**
*(Benchmark: Provided examples â‰ˆ 3-4. Scores 1 or 2 in ANY category trigger FAILURE)*

1.  **Layout & Composition (1-5):** (Clarity, Organization, Use of Space)
    *   1: Chaotic/Cluttered (**FAIL**)
    *   2: Functional but messy (**FAIL**)
    *   3: Acceptable, clear enough (Baseline)
    *   4: Good, organized, well-spaced (Baseline+)
    *   5: Excellent, balanced, strong hierarchy, polished

2.  **Contrast & Readability (1-5):** (Element vs Background, Text Legibility)
    *   1: Very low contrast, illegible elements/text (**FAIL**)
    *   2: Barely sufficient contrast, difficult reading (**FAIL**)
    *   3: Adequate contrast, functional readability (Baseline)
    *   4: Good contrast, clear readability (Baseline+)
    *   5: Excellent contrast, high readability, aids focus

3.  **Color Palette & Style (1-5):** (Cohesion, Appeal, Distinction)
    *   1: Clashing/Jarring colors, visually unpleasant (**FAIL**)
    *   2: Bland, muddy, or inconsistent colors (**FAIL**)
    *   3: Acceptable palette, colors functional (Baseline)
    *   4: Good, cohesive palette, aids distinction, appealing (Baseline+)
    *   5: Excellent, strategic color use, visually polished & distinct

4.  **Animation Quality (1-5):** (Smoothness, Technical Execution)
    *   1: Very jerky, glitchy, broken animations (**FAIL**)
    *   2: Noticeably choppy or abrupt animations (**FAIL**)
    *   3: Mostly smooth standard animations (Baseline)
    *   4: Smooth and fluid animations (Baseline+)
    *   5: Seamless, polished technical execution

5.  **Animation Effectiveness (1-5):** (Relevance, Pacing, Clarity Aid, Engagement)
    *   1: Irrelevant/Distracting animations, hinders understanding (**FAIL**)
    *   2: Animations feel random, poorly paced, add little value (**FAIL**)
    *   3: Relevant standard animations, adequate pacing (Baseline)
    *   4: Animations enhance understanding, good pacing, engaging (Baseline+)
    *   5: Purposeful animations significantly clarify/engage, excellent pacing

**Part C: Overall Assessment**

1.  **Part A Verdict:** (YES/NO) - All Core Requirements Met?
2.  **Part B Scores:** Layout:#, Contrast:#, Palette:#, AnimQual:#, AnimEff:#
3.  **Part B Average:** (Calculate average score across 5 categories)
4.  **Qualitative Check:** Any B score 1 or 2? (YES/NO). Is B average < 4.3? (YES/NO)
5.  **Summary:** Brief overall success? Strengths/Weaknesses (ref. specific Part B scores)? State reason for failure if applicable (Part A fail, Low B score, Low B avg).
6.  **Conclusion:**
    *   If Part A Verdict=NO OR Any B score is 1/2 OR Part B Average < 4.3: **"Overall Assessment: FAIL"**
    *   Otherwise (Part A=YES AND All B scores >= 3 AND B Average >= 4.3): **"Overall Assessment: PASS"**

**(LLM Reminder):** Check A first. Then check ALL B scores: ANY 1 or 2 = FAIL. Calculate B average: < 4.3 = FAIL. If A passes AND B scores all >= 3 AND B average >= 4.3, then PASS. Use refs as 3-4 baseline. 5 = polished use of *standard* tools. Note reason for failure.**
